# GWAS notebook


## Getting Started

In this notebook, a collection of population genetic data analysis codes has been compiled
to be a tool for development and comprehensive analysis One of the advantages of this notebook
is that we can develop and change the edited codes at any 
time in order to have the best pipeline of this complete one for doing the GWAS prrojects..

### Installing

A step by step pipeline for download and installing GWAS software and tools 

#Step_1 Downloading & installation toools

### Plink

 Plink tools can be download from  [Plink](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/))

    PLINK1.9 : https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/

    #Create directories
    cd ~
    mkdir tools
    cd tools
    mkdir bin
    mkdir plink
    mkdir plink2

### Style test

Checks if the best practices and the right coding style has been used.
